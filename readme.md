## Overview

This is a simple Pong template in Phaser 3 built with modern JavaScript. 

[You can watch a raw, uncut video series of this template being made on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLumYWZ2t7CRvdJJ206QarbisxYPAyYwj0)

We start with an empty folder and create the game from there. You'll see the entire process of mistakes, thinking, and looking at the documentation!
